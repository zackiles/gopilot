#### Changes Made
- Created new `internal/actions/actions.go` file implementing the Action interface and registry
- Updated `cmd/main.go` to support the new --action flag and action processing
- Created example action implementation in `cmd/actions/edit_code.go`
- Added GetHistory and SetHistory methods to Session struct
- Updated README.md with new --action flag documentation and Actions section
- Created AI-CHANGELOG.md to track AI contributions

#### Reasoning
Implemented a plugin system for actions to allow for specialized processing of inputs and outputs. This enhancement makes the CLI more extensible and allows for task-specific optimizations like code editing, while maintaining a clean separation of concerns through the plugin architecture.

#### Notes
The implementation uses a registry pattern to allow for dynamic loading of actions, making it easy to add new actions without modifying the core codebase.
